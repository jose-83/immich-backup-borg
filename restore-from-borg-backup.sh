# Note that for the database restore to proceed properly, it requires a completely fresh install
# (i.e. the Immich server has never run since creating the Docker containers). If the Immich app
# has run, Postgres conflicts may be encountered upon database restoration
# (relation already exists, violated foreign key constraints, multiple primary keys, etc.),
# in which case you need to delete the DB_DATA_LOCATION folder to reset the database.

# tip
# Some deployment methods make it difficult to start the database without also starting the server.
# In these cases, you may set the environment variable DB_SKIP_MIGRATIONS=true before starting the services.
# This will prevent the server from running migrations that interfere with the restore process.
# Be sure to remove this variable and restart the services after the database is restored.
